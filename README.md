# <strong>TIENDA ONLINE CON REACT-ECOMMERCE</strong>

:small_red_triangle:The idea of the online store is to be able to have a functional Web Application to be able to make purchases and that the UI is friendly to the user.


This project was started with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# :exclamation:To run the proyect:

In the project directory, you must use the command:

### `npm start`

This way you run the app in development mode/.

React this way provides you with a Local Host [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)that you can view in your favorite search engine.


Finally all the changes you make on the app will make the page reload.
